# Project1

# Description
Created a web application of a collection of popular movies, that shows the information, rating, and trailer for the user.
We came up with the movie library concept because we wanted to create a simplified way for the user to search and find information on the latest and/or popular movies. 
As a movie fanatic we want to provide an easy, user-friendly website to help find their favorite movie, or a movie they have never seen before.
A feature that is added to the movie library is a Watchlist button which gives the user an option to create a movie list to watch the movie and remove.
